		<p>My favorite animal is the lion because it is considered the king of the jungle since no other beast can compete with it. The Bible uses the lion to make comparisons. A brave man, for example, is said to have a heart like a lion. In other words, these giant cats are synonymous with courage.</p>
		<p>In addition to being described as having large teeth and molars, it is alluded to as having brave, angry, and hungry people. Similarly, it is explained in a passage that one should attack like a lion. Additionally, it was used as a symbol of war in ancient times. The emblem is present in all cultures, representing values such as power, strength, courage, royalty, or dignity, and is used indistinguishably in secular and religious contexts.</p>
